# Portfolio

Portfolio page created using Bootstrap 4.3.1 and J-Query.

The aim of this project is to showcase skillset with bootstrap.

This is part of Web Design For Everybody Capstone course on Coursera, I've also done a combo and learned from Udemy how to create this type of theme and made it my own.
